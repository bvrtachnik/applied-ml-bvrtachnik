### 1. Clarity & Organization  
The notebook was clearly structured and easy to follow. Each section was labeled and included reflections, which helped connect the steps. The process made sense and was approachable.

### 2. Feature Selection & Justification  
The features chosen — age, passenger class, and family — were relevant and thoughtfully selected. The reasoning behind each choice was explained, and the idea to create a "family" feature was a creative touch.

### 3. Model Performance & Comparisons  
It was helpful to see two different models tested. The reflections showed an understanding of why one model performed better than the other. Adding a stratified split or testing more features at once might improve the decision tree results.

### 4. Reflection Quality  
The reflections were honest and relatable. They clearly described challenges, learning moments, and what could be done next. The effort to troubleshoot and adapt when things didn’t work was a strong point of the project.

Overall, this was a thoughtful and well-organized notebook. The author tested different ideas and showed real understanding of the project’s goals, even when some models didn’t work as expected.
