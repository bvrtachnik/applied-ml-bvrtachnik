# **Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction**  

## **Objective**
The goal of this lab was to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using different machine learning models and combinations of input features.

### **Models Used**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
  - RBF Kernel  
  - Linear Kernel  
  - Polynomial Kernel  
  - Sigmoid Kernel  
- **Neural Network (MLPClassifier)**

#### **Variables**
- **Survived**: Target variable (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived)  
- **Alone**: Binary indicator of whether the passenger was traveling alone  
- **Age**: Age of the passenger  
- **Family Size**: Total number of family members on board (siblings/spouses + parents/children + 1)
